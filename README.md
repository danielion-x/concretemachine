Given an Excel File and inputs from our GUI, our code performs previously rigorous analysis on material specimen
to extrapolate key mechanical properties such as the Young's Modulus and the Ultimate Strength. We hope to
implement machine learning to predict the cause of specimen failure, as well as the expected strength of
a mix given ingredients by weight.
